            <p>Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups
                of genera, not all of which are closely related. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and Africa.[1]
                Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—2 in North America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3
                in Australia.</p>
            <p>
                Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted
                eagle (Aquila pennata), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk
                (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight – despite
                the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures.
                The smallest species of eagle is the South Nicobar serpent eagle
                <i>(Spilornis klossi)</i> , at 450 g (0.99 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. Like
                all birds of prey, eagles have very large, hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular
                legs, and powerful talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes
                are extremely powerful. It is estimated that the martial eagle, whose eye is more than twice as long as a
                human eye, has a visual acuity 3.0 to 3.6 times that of humans. This acuity enables eagles to spot potential
                prey from a very long distance.[2] This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils
                which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light. The female of all known species of eagles
                is larger than the male.</p>

            <blockquote>
                Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older,
                larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The dominant chick tends to be a female,
                as they are bigger than the male. The parents take no action to stop the killing.
